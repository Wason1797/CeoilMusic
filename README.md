# CeoilMusic

Hi guys, this repo is to share some music loops I had fun creating for videogames in various game jams. Finally, I have decided to share them with the world.

If you are interested on modifying some of the loops or just check their structure, then you need to download the files and use [Boscca Ceoil](https://boscaceoil.net/).

Special thanks to all of those who gave me feedback while I was creating them.
